# A/B Testing: Early Repayment Feature Impact

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project simulates and analyzes the impact of an early repayment feature on loan repayment behavior using a synthetic dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how A/B testing can be applied to evaluate product features in a fintech context.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
A synthetic dataset of 1,000 users, with control and treatment groups, including:
- Loan amount
- Loan tenure
- Credit score
- Repayment outcome (paid, late, defaulted)

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Statistical testing (proportions)
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## ðŸ§ª Analysis Goals
- Compare repayment outcomes between control and treatment groups
- Visualize distribution of repayment status
- Test statistical significance of any observed differences

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis (to be created)
- `data/synthetic_loan_data.csv`: Synthetic loan-level data for analysis

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps
- Add A/B testing analysis using statistical tests
- Visualize repayment distributions
- Document key findings and insights
